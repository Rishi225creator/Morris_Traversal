# Morris_Traversal

---This is one of tree traversal technique which uses O(N) time complexity for traversing and O(1) Space Complexity

---Here We Basically try to Convert Existing Tree Into thread binary tree which helps in traversing the whole tree

---Threaded Binary Tree Which Look Like The Below Figure
